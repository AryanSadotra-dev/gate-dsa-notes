📘 Lecture 1: Background of Asymptotic Notations
(Analysis of Algorithms)
====================================================================

This lecture builds the foundation required to understand asymptotic
notations. The notations themselves (Big-O, Big-Ω, Big-Θ, etc.) are NOT
introduced here. Instead, the lecture focuses on answering one key
question: WHY do we need asymptotic notations in algorithm analysis?

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Why This Topic Is Important
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Asymptotic notations form the base of the entire Data Structures and
Algorithms subject. If this background is clear, then concepts such as
time complexity, space complexity, and algorithm comparison become easy
and intuitive. From an exam perspective, especially GATE, at least
2–3 questions are directly or indirectly related to this topic.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2. What Are We Trying To Do?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
We want a method to represent:
- Time complexity
- Space complexity

For very large input sizes, in a way that is independent of the machine,
compiler, or programming language. This representation is achieved
using asymptotic notations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Meaning of “Asymptotic”
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The word “asymptotic” comes from the mathematical concept of an
asymptote. An asymptote is a line that a curve approaches as it extends
towards infinity.

Example:
For the curve y = 1/x, as x → ∞, the curve approaches the x-axis and
y-axis. These axes bound the curve at infinity, even though the curve
never crosses them.

Thus, asymptotic means studying the behavior of a function at infinity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Why “Infinity” Matters in Algorithms
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Algorithms are not written for very small inputs like 5, 10, or 20.
If the input size is small, humans can often solve the problem manually,
making algorithms unnecessary. Algorithms are written for very large
inputs, where the input size tends towards infinity. Therefore, while
analyzing algorithms, we focus on the behavior when n → ∞, not for
small values of n.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5. What Is Being Analysed?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
We analyze:
- The time required by an algorithm
- The space required by an algorithm

Both are analyzed as functions of input size (n). This idea was already
introduced in A-Priori analysis.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Comparing Algorithms Using Functions
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Consider two algorithms:
A₁: Time = n² + n + 1
A₂: Time = n²

For small values of n, n² + n + 1 is greater than n², so A₁ appears to
take more time. However, when n → ∞, the n² term dominates and the n and
constant terms become negligible. Asymptotically, both algorithms behave
like n² and are considered to have the same time complexity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Dominating Term Concept
--------------------------------------------------------------------
When the input size is very large:
- The highest power of n dominates
- Lower powers of n are ignored
- Constant terms are ignored

Example:
n² + n + 1000 → n²

Only the dominating term matters for asymptotic analysis.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Constants Do Not Matter
--------------------------------------------------------------------
As n → ∞:
n, 2n, n/100, and 1000n all grow at the same rate asymptotically.
Multiplication or division by constants does not affect growth, because
a constant multiplied by infinity is still infinity. Hence, constants
are ignored in asymptotic analysis.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Example: n vs 2n
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Algorithm A₁: Time = n
Algorithm A₂: Time = 2n

Mathematically, A₂ takes twice the time. Asymptotically, both grow
linearly and are treated as the same, because their growth rates are
identical for very large n.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
10. Example: n vs 10000n
--------------------------------------------------------------------
For small inputs, 10000n is much larger than n. For very large inputs,
both grow linearly and the difference becomes insignificant.
Asymptotically, n and 10000n are considered equivalent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
11. Why Exact Time Is Not Needed
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Exact execution time depends on CPU speed, memory, compiler, and machine
architecture. We do not want machine-dependent analysis. Instead, we
want a machine-independent way to compare algorithms. That is why
constants are ignored and exact counts are avoided.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
12. Machine Independence (Very Important)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Asymptotic analysis ensures that the same algorithm has the same
complexity on different machines. Without machine independence,
algorithm analysis would be meaningless.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
13. Final Conclusions of the Lecture
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- Analysis is done for very large input sizes
- Constants do not matter
- Only the dominating term matters
- Exact execution time is not required
- Analysis must be machine independent

Asymptotic notations help represent time and space complexity in a clean
and mathematical way.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
14. Why We Need Asymptotic Notations (One Line)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Asymptotic notations are mathematical tools used to represent time and
space complexity of algorithms for very large inputs, independent of
machine specifications.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
15. Notations to Be Studied (Next Lectures)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The five asymptotic notations are:
- Big-O (O)
- Big-Omega (Ω)
- Big-Theta (Θ)
- Small-o
- Small-omega (ω)

These notations are NOT introduced in this lecture. This lecture only
builds the background required to understand them.
