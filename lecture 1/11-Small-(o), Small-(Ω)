Asymptotic Notations – Small-o, Small-Ω
(Big-O, Big-Ω, Θ Relations + Board Questions Explained)
(Teacher’s Full Classroom Teaching Style – Image + Lecture Reconstruction)
====================================================================

⚠️ These notes are a direct reconstruction of the lecture,
including board drawings, arrows, crossings, circles, and questions.

⚠️ Nothing is skipped.
⚠️ Repetition is intentional.
⚠️ Images are verbally decoded into logic and meaning.
⚠️ Written for GitHub + deep algorithmic understanding.

====================================================================


------------------------------------------------------------
1. Opening Context – Why This Lecture Exists
------------------------------------------------------------

The instructor begins by clearly stating that:

• Big-O notation
• Big-Ω notation
• Big-Θ notation

have already been **completed properly** in previous lectures.

Only **two notations are left**:
• Small-o
• Small-omega (ω)

He honestly tells students:

“These are not very important for exams,
but you should NOT skip them completely.”

Why?
Because they give **conceptual depth** and help you
understand **dominance vs strict dominance**.

He also promises:
Today, he will explain **why Θ exists**
and **why small-θ DOES NOT exist**.


------------------------------------------------------------
2. Board Setup (Image Explanation)
------------------------------------------------------------

On the board, the instructor writes:

f(n) = 3n + 2     (underlined)

On the right side of the board:
• O(n)
• O(n²)
• O(n³)
• O(n log n)

These are written with arrows, circles, and question marks.

🔍 Meaning of the drawing:
The teacher is visually showing that **one function can satisfy
multiple Big-O bounds**, because Big-O allows “≥ or =”.

This visual directly contrasts with **Small-o**, where equality is forbidden.


------------------------------------------------------------
3. Revisiting Big-O (Very Briefly, for Contrast)
------------------------------------------------------------

In Big-O, we say:

f(n) = O(g(n))
if there exists **AT LEAST ONE positive constant C**
such that:

f(n) ≤ C·g(n)  for all n ≥ n₀

This is why:
• f(n) = 3n + 2
• can be O(n)
• can be O(n log n)
• can be O(n²)
• can even be O(n³)

Because Big-O is an **upper bound**, not a tight bound.


------------------------------------------------------------
4. Introducing Small-o (Core Definition)
------------------------------------------------------------

Now the instructor switches tone and says:

“Now focus carefully.
Here is where students usually make mistakes.”

Definition (spoken slowly):

f(n) = o(g(n))
IF
for **EVERY positive constant C**
there exists a value n₀
such that for all n ≥ n₀,

f(n) < C·g(n)     (STRICT inequality)

Key stress points (repeated multiple times in lecture):

1️⃣ **For EVERY positive constant**
   – not at least one  
   – every possible positive real number  
   – 0.1, 0.001, 100, 1/100000, anything  

2️⃣ **Strictly less than**
   – NOT ≤  
   – equality is NOT allowed  

3️⃣ After some n₀, this must hold forever  


------------------------------------------------------------
5. Core Intuition (Teacher’s Main Explanation)
------------------------------------------------------------

The teacher explains this intuition in multiple ways.

He says:

“In Small-o, constants don’t matter anymore.”

Why?

Because if **even after multiplying g(n) by a very small constant**,
g(n) is still bigger than f(n),
then f(n) is **fundamentally smaller**.

This means:
• The dominance is not due to constants
• The dominance is due to growth rate


------------------------------------------------------------
6. Height Analogy (Board Drawing Explanation)
------------------------------------------------------------

On the board, the teacher draws two circles:

• One circle lower
• One circle much higher

He draws arrows:
• Try to pull the higher one down
• Try to push it up

Explanation:

If one function is already much larger in growth,
then:
• Making the constant smaller does not help
• Making the constant bigger does not matter

The taller person always remains taller.

That is Small-o.


------------------------------------------------------------
7. Second (Easier) Definition of Small-o
------------------------------------------------------------

Now the teacher writes a new definition:

f(n) = o(g(n))
IFF

lim (n → ∞) [ f(n) / g(n) ] = 0

He explicitly says:

“This definition is VERY EASY and VERY IMPORTANT.”

Why?

Because:
• No constants
• No guessing C
• Just check the limit

If the ratio goes to zero,
then f(n) is negligible compared to g(n).


------------------------------------------------------------
8. Board Question 1 (From Image)
------------------------------------------------------------

Question written on the board:

f(n) = 3n + 2   → TRUE?

Options:
a) f(n) = o(n²)        ✓
b) f(n) = o(n log n)   ✓
c) f(n) = o(n³)        ✓
d) f(n) = o(n)         ✗

Now the teacher explains **each option verbally**.


------------------------------------------------------------
9. Option (a): f(n) = o(n²)
------------------------------------------------------------

Check the limit:

(3n + 2) / n² → 0

n² grows much faster than n.

So YES:
f(n) = o(n²)

Teacher’s money analogy:
“If you have one crore squared money,
then 3 crore + 2 rupees means nothing.”


------------------------------------------------------------
10. Option (b): f(n) = o(n log n)
------------------------------------------------------------

Check the limit:

(3n + 2) / (n log n)
= (3 + 2/n) / log n → 0

Because log n → ∞.

So YES:
f(n) = o(n log n)


------------------------------------------------------------
11. Option (c): f(n) = o(n³)
------------------------------------------------------------

Same logic:

(3n + 2) / n³ → 0

So YES:
f(n) = o(n³)


------------------------------------------------------------
12. Option (d): f(n) = o(n) ❌
------------------------------------------------------------

Check the limit:

(3n + 2) / n → 3

Limit ≠ 0.

So this FAILS.

Teacher’s warning:

“If someone chooses a very small constant,
you will not be able to prove it.”

Hence:
f(n) ≠ o(n)


------------------------------------------------------------
13. Important Relationship (Board Arrows)
------------------------------------------------------------

The teacher draws arrows showing:

Small-o  ⇒  Big-O   (ALWAYS)

But:
Big-O  ⇏  Small-o

Why?

Because:
• Big-O allows equality
• Small-o forbids equality


------------------------------------------------------------
14. Introducing Small-Omega (ω)
------------------------------------------------------------

Now the teacher flips the logic.

Definition:

f(n) = ω(g(n))
IF
for **EVERY positive constant C**
there exists n₀ such that for all n ≥ n₀,

f(n) > C·g(n)   (STRICT)

Again:
• EVERY constant
• STRICT inequality


------------------------------------------------------------
15. Limit Definition of Small-Omega
------------------------------------------------------------

Second definition:

f(n) = ω(g(n))
IFF

lim (n → ∞) [ g(n) / f(n) ] = 0

Meaning:
f(n) grows so fast that g(n) becomes negligible.


------------------------------------------------------------
16. Why Equality Is NOT Allowed (Critical Insight)
------------------------------------------------------------

Example discussed verbally:

f(n) = 3n + 2  
g(n) = n  

Even though f(n) > n for large n,
you CANNOT say f(n) = ω(n).

Why?

Because:
For large constants (like C = 10000),
the inequality fails.

Since definition says:
“for EVERY constant”,
even ONE failure breaks everything.


------------------------------------------------------------
17. Why Small-Theta Does NOT Exist
------------------------------------------------------------

This is the conceptual climax.

Big-Θ says:
C₁·g(n) ≤ f(n) ≤ C₂·g(n)

Equality allowed.

If we try to define Small-Θ,
we would need:

• f(n) strictly bigger than g(n)
• AND strictly smaller than g(n)
• For EVERY constant

This is **logically impossible**.

Hence:
❌ Small-Θ does not exist.

That is why we never define it.


------------------------------------------------------------
18. Final Summary (Teacher’s Own Words, Structured)
------------------------------------------------------------

Small-o:
• f(n) is STRICTLY smaller than g(n)
• Ratio → 0

Small-Omega:
• f(n) is STRICTLY larger than g(n)
• Reverse ratio → 0

Big-O / Big-Ω:
• Equality allowed

Constants:
• Become meaningless at infinity

Growth rate:
• Everything


------------------------------------------------------------
19. Lecture Closure
------------------------------------------------------------

The instructor concludes:

“All five asymptotic notations are now complete.”

Next lecture:
• Properties
• Symmetry
• Transitivity

He encourages students to **think**, not memorize,
because algorithm analysis improves only by thinking.
