📘 Properties of an Algorithm & Problem-Solving Mindset
====================================================================

To decide whether a set of steps qualifies as a valid and good
algorithm, it must satisfy certain essential properties. An algorithm
is not just any sequence of instructions; it is a precise, logical,
and reliable method to solve a problem.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Properties of an Algorithm
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Each Step Must Be a Basic Operation
Every step in an algorithm must be simple, clear, and executable.
Vague or abstract statements such as “sort the numbers” are not valid
algorithmic steps unless broken down into basic operations. Each step
should be something that can be directly performed.

2. Finite Termination
An algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps. If a
process keeps running indefinitely and never stops, it cannot be
considered an algorithm.

3. At Least One Output
An algorithm must produce at least one output. Without an output, the
algorithm has no meaning. For example, checking whether a number is
prime must produce an output such as YES or NO.

4. Zero or More Inputs
An algorithm may take:
- No input (e.g., an alarm system)
- One input (e.g., checking if a number is prime)
- Multiple inputs (e.g., sorting a list of numbers)

5. Proper Input–Output Mapping
For a given set of inputs, the output must be well-defined, fixed, and
correct. This property ensures the correctness and reliability of the
algorithm.

6. Platform Independent
An algorithm must be independent of hardware, operating system, and
programming language. The logic of the algorithm should work on any
machine and can be implemented in any language.

7. Unambiguous Steps
Each step of an algorithm must be clear and unambiguous. There should
be no room for multiple interpretations. For example, an expression
like A - B - C is ambiguous unless clearly grouped as (A - B) - C.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Algorithm vs Program
--------------------------------------------------------------------
An algorithm represents logical steps and problem-solving logic. It is
language-independent and platform-independent. A program is the actual
code written in a specific programming language, making it language-
dependent and platform-dependent. Algorithms focus on logic, while
programs focus on syntax and implementation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem Solving Using Algorithms
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Coding is not the first step in problem solving. A correct and
professional approach follows this flow:

1. Problem Definition
Understand the problem clearly. Identify what is given and what is
required.

2. Identify Inputs and Outputs
Decide all possible inputs and clearly define the expected outputs.

3. Algorithm Design
Write step-by-step logic while ensuring all algorithm properties are
satisfied.

4. Testing
Test the algorithm using multiple inputs and edge cases to detect
errors early.

5. Optimization
Improve time efficiency and space efficiency. Always ask whether the
solution can be made faster or more memory-efficient.

6. Implementation
Convert the finalized algorithm into code using any suitable
programming language.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Importance of Testing
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Errors may occur due to misunderstanding requirements, incorrect
assumptions, or missing edge cases. Testing helps catch logical
mistakes, improves reliability, and reduces failures after deployment.
In real-world software, testing continues even after release.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Key Takeaways
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- An algorithm must satisfy strict properties to be valid
- Writing code without understanding the problem leads to failure
- Proper testing and optimization are essential
- Strong fundamentals improve problem-solving skills
- This mindset is crucial for GATE, placements, and real-world software
