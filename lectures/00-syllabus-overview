# DSA Course Syllabus Overview (Lecture 0)

## Teaching Strategy
- Start from absolute basics
- Build concepts gradually
- Focus on GATE-level depth
- Heavy emphasis on problem-solving

---

## Why DSA is Important
- Core subject for GATE
- Required for M.Tech & Advanced Algorithms
- Essential for placements
- Foundation for AI, ML, NLP, Data Science

---

## Prerequisites

### Programming
- Variables & data types
- Loops (for, while)
- Basic C programming

### Mathematics
- Sequences & series
- Logarithms
- Recurrence relations

> Mathematics is mandatory and will not be skipped.
